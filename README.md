### DAKS - Azure Devito at scale using k8s and dask
For seismic imaging, the repository shows how you can leverage open-source PDE solver [devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) ), to perform Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) at scale on Azure using Dask and k8s
a.	CPU cores
b.	ICL expects current code to work on “unlimited” # of cores
Multi GPU cores per 1 node coming -in not earlier than in a few months 
Multi-GPU multi core will come later but likely as an easy by-product of “Multi GPU cores per 1 node" work.
